This repository has been created to share malware samples for analysis, research, reverse engineering and review by defensive security operators. Malware dropped during honeypot interaction give researchers an opportunity to observe real attacks in order to provide modern defenses for networks and endpoints. If you are unsure if you can safely handle these samples then you should do further research to ensure the safe analysis of these samples.
