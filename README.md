# malware-samples
Malware samples collected from honeypots run on public cloud.

This repository has been created to share malware samples for analysis, research, reverse engineering and review by defensive security operators. Malware dropped during honeypot interaction give researchers an opportunity to observe real attacks in order to provide modern defenses for networks and endpoints. If you are unsure if you can safely handle these samples then you should do further research to ensure the safe analysis of these samples.

## DISCLAIMER
<b> EXTREME CAUTION shall be used in the handling and analysis of these samples. Do NOT run the malware unless you are performing dynamic analysis in a highly isolated malware lab.</b> Even then, it is highly recommended they be run in a VM with no internet connection (or a simulated internet connection), without guest additions. The samples in this repository are live malware and they can cause harm to your computer and/or other computers on the network (e.g. some of these samples are worms, and can spread across your network).

You are responsible for understanding and adhering to your local, state, and federal laws, governances, and regulations. <b>Do not use the malware samples for illegal purposes.</b> I am not responsible for any damage that may have been caused by malware samples with the same or similar signatures. These samples are provided to the public for educational purposes. <b>The use of the samples in this repository are strictly limited to educational purposes only.</b>

By downloading and unzipping these files, you agree to the terms in this README.md.
